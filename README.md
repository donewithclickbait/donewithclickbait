# donewithclickbait

We all know what clickbait is now, it's become a massive part of the user experience online. Link titles and images that tell you enough to arouse your interest, but not so much that you won't click on that link - bringing with it ad revenue from various sources. Sure, you could just ignore it, but that's easier said than done with the massive proliferation on social media by these sites. So, what can be done? 

The majority of their articles is made up of content taken from other sites - twitter, facebook, instagram and youtube - further expanded on with a few words from the author. The code here automatically scans predefined clickbait sites, takes this embedded content and reposts it on Google App Engine, leaving it for you to browse on a single page. No links, no ads, just the raw content that attracted you in the first place. 

Code is also included to repost the embedded content on facebook and twitter.
